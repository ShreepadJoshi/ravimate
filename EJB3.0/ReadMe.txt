You need to have Eclipse Version: 3.4.2 (GANYMEDE)
there are two project 

after checkout rename 
1 EJB3SessionBean 
2 EJB3Test

1 EJB3SessionBean1 
2 EJB3Test1


then 

for EJB3SessionBean we need to create "EJB project" (with name EJB3SessionBean)
set jboss 5 
and select EJB version 3.0
click OK.


for EJB3Test we need to create web - "Dynamic Web project" (EJB3Test)
