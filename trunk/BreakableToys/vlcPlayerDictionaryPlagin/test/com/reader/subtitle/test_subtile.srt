Ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:22,246 --> 00:01:23,144
Hope you 're well rested.

3
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:24,640
ln about five minutes,

00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:27,114
we will be beginning our descent
into New Delhi lnternational airport -

5
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:29,685
- on to runway 4R.

6
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:32,449
Weather on the ground
is a cool fifteen degrees Celsius.

7
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:34,854
There's a slight haze
and a little bit of turbulence,

8
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,290
so please keep your seatbelts fastened.

9
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:38,652
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

Hi, when did you get here?
Sit down!

12
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,693
Please, act like you don't know me.

13
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:47,321
l don't know you .

14
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:49,857
Don't look at me.

15
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:52,567
Oh.

16
00:02:55,205 --> 00:02:57,196
So, how was your flight?

17
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,233
Don't talk to me -

18
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,070
- just do as you were told.

19
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:06,943
God. Fucking mental, some people.

20
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,889
Open the door!

21
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:39,997
l got it last time.

22
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:44,373
Arup! Open the fucking door!

23
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,135
He's lying! l got it last time.

24
00:05:57,154 --> 00:05:59,884
Bastard, one more time l'll cut
your balls off and make you earrings.

25
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:05,252
All right fucker, you 're dead.

26
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:11,961
You deaf?

27
00:06:14,237 --> 00:06:15,329
When did you get back?

28
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,100
Just now.

29
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:18,469
Oh my gosh.

30
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:22,074
Tashi, you 're scratching me.

31
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:23,203
Please go shave.

32
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:25,640
Can't.

33
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:26,807
There's no water.

34
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:29,385
What do you mean, there's no water?
You get two hours of water every morning.

35
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:31,954
Yeah, we forgot to put the buckets out.

36
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:33,716
What do you mean,
forgot to put the buckets out?

37
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:34,756
Him.

38
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:35,919
What?

39
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:37,186
lt was his turn.

40
00:06:37,294 --> 00:06:39,023
Yeah, but you could hear
the water running, right?

41
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:41,290
All you had to do was get out of bed
and put the buckets out.

42
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:43,298
lt would have taken you all of thirty seconds.

43
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,064
Yeah. But it was his turn.

44
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,931
Oh my god! l can't believe
you guys live like this.

45
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,939
What are you getting so worked up for?
We'll do it tomorrow.

46
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:53,169
Because you 're meeting my parents for lunch.

47
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:55,437
l want you to shave and look presentable.

48
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:57,012
l'm meeting your parents?

49
00:06:58,014 --> 00:06:59,106
Wear this.

50
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,440
l've told you not to buy me
such expensive stuff.

51
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:04,213
Just wear it, Tashi.
People judge you by the way you look.

52
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:06,448
Yeah, l don't hang out with
any of those people.

53
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:11,555
Listen, l'm not joking, okay Tashi?
You have no idea how pissed l am.

54
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:14,394
l'm going home now. Don't be late.

55
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:22,327
Oh, man -

56
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:31,174
Baby, can you drop this for me, please?

57
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:32,976
- This afternoon? lt's urgent.
- l have an assignment, can't...

58
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,550
Here's the address.

59
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:39,081
That girl really loves you .

60
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:41,420
Lucky bastard.

61
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:50,092
So, where is she?

62
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,394
l'm looking.

63
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,526
Why? You don't know
what she looks like.

64
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:55,260
Shut up.

65
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:56,998
You have her number?

66
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,407
No.

67
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,273
Man, you 're the cow
on the information superhighway.

68
00:08:01,378 --> 00:08:03,778
Me? You 're the one
still shooting film, you choot.

69
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,507
Digital is for fucking tourists.

70
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:11,318
You 're ringing,
so you must be Tashi.

71
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:13,821
Hi, l'm Menaka.

72
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:15,983
Hey, hi, Tashi.

73
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:18,451
A couple more hours and
we would've found you .

74
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:20,621
This is Nitin, my photographer.

75
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:24,022
Menaka's a special correspondent,
just started with us today.

76
00:08:24,134 --> 00:08:27,365
Hi, Special Correspondent.
Welcome.

77
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:31,033
Alright, shall we?

78
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:34,372
Because l want to do everything l can,
you know. No limits.

79
00:08:37,214 --> 00:08:40,183
How would you define everything?

80
00:08:40,283 --> 00:08:42,217
Singing. Acting.

81
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:44,253
l think, directing. No wait.

82
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:46,015
Definitely directing.

83
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:47,146
l paint.

84
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:49,452
l'm working on
my first collection of poems.

85
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,495
And l want to have my very own
clothes line one day.

86
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:55,061
Clothing line.

87
00:08:55,498 --> 00:08:56,465
What?

88
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:57,533
Never mind.

89
00:08:58,235 --> 00:09:02,001
So, what do you enjoy most,
out of everything that you do?

90
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:03,003
Everything.

91
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,533
Of course. Just everything.

92
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:07,573
That's why she does it all.

93
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:09,238
Just -

94
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:11,911
Lovely.

95
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:13,209
Could you sing us one of your songs?

96
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,448
Oh, l don't know.

97
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:18,214
Come on, we've only got
a couple of minutes, come on.

98
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,049
- Okay.

99
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:22,021
- Brilliant.

100
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,990
Okay, it's called -

101
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:27,288
l hate you , like l love you .

102
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:29,521
Like l love you in brackets.

103
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,333
So, it's like, l hate you ,
brackets, like l love you .

104
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:39,299
l hate you , like l love you ,
in brackets. That's brilliant.

105
00:09:43,246 --> 00:09:44,941
I hate you ,

106
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:46,679
IIke I Iove you ,

107
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:48,615
I hate you ,

108
00:09:49,386 --> 00:09:51,217
IIke I Iove you .

109
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:53,385
And then the drums come in.

110
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:02,431
That's it.

111
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:08,061
Are those your lyrics?

112
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:08,865
Yeah -

113
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:10,030
We shouldn't have
asked you to sing -

114
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,630
- l can't get it
out of my head now.

115
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:12,537
So true.

116
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:14,405
Hey, do you want me to
sign something for you ?

117
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:15,705
Because l don't mind.

118
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:17,373
Really? That's -

119
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:21,109
You know how some celebrities
get all high and mighty?

120
00:10:21,217 --> 00:10:22,616
l just don't get it.

121
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,617
Waste of my time.

122
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:32,752
Hey, that's priceless.

123
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:36,091
From this moment on,
any time you 're depressed -

124
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,064
- l want you to
take a look at this and say -

125
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:41,460
- l hate you , like l love you ,
in brackets.

126
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,700
lt's a magic photo.

127
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:47,735
You can have it.
Tuneless and brainless.

128
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:50,645
Hey man, being hot is like
a full time job.

129
00:10:50,747 --> 00:10:53,238
Dude, there's real news to be covered,
and this is the crap l get?

130
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,181
Listen, she was news to me, okay?

131
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:57,253
And honestly, l'd
be happy to cover her anytime.

132
00:10:57,354 --> 00:10:58,480
With what, your paunch?

133
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:00,079
For starters.

134
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,680
You met my friend Nitin,
the serial rapist?

135
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:03,724
Hello, serial rapist.

136
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:04,922
Did you get something?

137
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:07,019
Yeah, some for you ,

138
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,563
All right, l'll be back

139
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:11,233
Menaka, nice to meet you .

140
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:14,635

141
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:17,533
- Hey!

142
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,732

00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:28,347

00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:29,110
Arup?

145
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:29,878
Can you hear me?

146
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:31,715
What, fucker?

147
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:34,255
Oh, no, no -

148
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:35,483

But do you think you can
make him a little happier?

153
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:45,064
Happier? Who, the banana?

154
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:47,659
Haan, you know like
he's having fun.

155
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:49,705
All his life he's wanted to
be in a banana-split -

156
00:11:49,806 --> 00:11:51,774
- and this is like a dream come true.

157
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:55,235
Dream come true, for the banana?

158
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:56,573
You know happy, something like -

159

No, no, no, now, the client is waiting -

164
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,849
Right now?

165
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:09,788
Drop everything else -
do it now.

166
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:12,761
HeIIo, Arup?

167
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,261
Arup, you there?

168
00:12:15,331 --> 00:12:16,298
- What?

169
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,424
Hey, I need a favour,
can you drop that package off for me?

170
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:20,160
No, l can't.

171
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,628
Didn't you hear that?

172
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:24,369
l'm stuck in fucking banana hell.

173
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:27,136
- And she wanted to touch a kIIIer whaIe.
- Come on they are IIke doIphIns.

174
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:27,971
Amma?

175
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:29,102
Papa? What are you doIng here?

176
00:12:29,212 --> 00:12:30,179
Surprise!

177
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:32,307
Surprise!

178
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:38,346
Even my mama's daughter got married
on the 29th of November -

179
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:40,582
- and they're so happy Mrs. Lhatoo!

180
00:12:41,858 --> 00:12:43,485
Sorry, 29th November?

181
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:46,787
That's just a month away.

182
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:48,158
You don't have to worry,

183
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:50,391
Your mother and l will do
all the running around.

184
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,592
lsn't that true, Mrs. Lhatoo?

185
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:52,827
That's what mothers do, beta.

186
00:12:58,641 --> 00:12:59,630
lt's one.

187
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:01,302
Where's that driver, mummy?

188
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:02,810
Wasn't he supposed to
be here at one?

189
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,539
l have to go the tailor's after this.

190
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:05,739
Relax, he'll be here.

191
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,649
Tashi, did you drop that stuff?

192
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,918
Hello? Yeah, Menaka -

193
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,447
- yeah?

194
00:13:13,623 --> 00:13:14,647
Yeah, l know where it is.

195
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:15,485
Yeah, l'll tell Nitin -

196
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:16,422
- Okay, bye.

197
00:13:17,694 --> 00:13:20,720
Uncle, Aunty - l'm really sorry, l've have
to go, something's come up at work.

198
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:23,623
No more uncle-aunty.

199
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:26,358
Beta, you 're family now.

200
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:28,596
From now on, mummy-daddy.

201
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:30,871
What do you say, Mr. Lhatoo?

202
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:32,273
That's how it is.

203
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:34,842
Tashi, beta, come with me, beta.

204
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:37,642
l should really get going, Daddy -

205
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:38,714
Tashi, come, come.

206
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:40,339
This will take hardly one minute. Come on -

207
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,654
You IIke It?

208
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:52,521
Good. Take it. lt's for you .

209
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:54,754
Oh, l can't, Daddy -

210
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:56,855
Forget it. We're not even discussing it.

211
00:13:57,934 --> 00:14:00,459
Bachche, we've even bought a flat for you .

212
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,696
Just five minutes away.

213
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:04,432
ln the morning we'll walk over
to your place for breakfast

214
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,839
and in the evening
you 'll both come over for dinner.

215
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:10,743
lt'll be wonderful. l just can't wait.

216
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:28,988
Delicate.

217
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:30,922
You can work wonders with the right model.

218
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:33,602
l'm guessing this is some for you -

219
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:35,170
- and some for me.

220
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:36,704
Bacche, say cheese.

221
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:38,467
Man, is nothing sacred?

222
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:39,837
He doesn't mind. l asked him.

223
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:45,444
So that pretty young thing
was a waste of your time

224
00:14:45,548 --> 00:14:47,175
and this is worthwhile?

225
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:48,716
l don't know what that says about you .

226
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:50,308
That he's a serious journalist.

227
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,819
Yeah. Or a necrophiliac.

228
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:53,821
Yeah, a gay necrophiliac.

229
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:55,888
Fucking idiots.

230
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:57,220
Yours.

231
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:58,453
Mine.

232
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:00,529
- You 're not coming in?
- No. Work to do.

233
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:04,694
Listen, l got to file this.
Can you drop this off for me?

234
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:05,699
No.

235
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:06,598
Thanks.

236
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:08,593
Here's the address.

237
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:13,001
Go.

238
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:18,808
What are you doing this evening?

239
00:15:19,816 --> 00:15:20,874
Oh, you know.

240
00:15:20,984 --> 00:15:21,814
Work.

241
00:15:22,752 --> 00:15:26,745
All work, no play, Tashi...
dull boy.

242
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:42,434
Give me one.

243
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:49,643
Make it spicy!

244
00:15:55,351 --> 00:15:56,249
Let me go.

245
00:15:56,753 --> 00:15:57,720
You want some of this?

246
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,581
200? Rate's gone up.

247
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,482
No, my darling.

248
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,456
Asshole.

249
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:44,745
Hi.

250
00:18:44,854 --> 00:18:45,912
Oh fuck!

251
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:49,818
What are you doing,
lying in the dark like that?

252
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:52,924
l'm sick, man.

253
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:55,088
l feel poisoned.

254
00:18:55,832 --> 00:18:57,163
Did you see a doctor?

255
00:18:58,034 --> 00:18:59,023
Yeah.

256
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:00,966
So here's what you need to do.

257
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,662
Just take my scooter.

258
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,937
Why?

259
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,098
Just take it.

260
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:07,508
Fucker!

261
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,009
Why am l taking your scooter?

262
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:11,204
Tashi asked me to
drop off this package.

263
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:13,576
That fucking thing is
still floating around?

264
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:14,945
Listen if l wasn't sick,
l'd do it.

265
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:16,018
Sure.

266
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:19,746
Listen, since you 're
going out in any case,

267
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:21,084
can you do me a favour?

268
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,054
What?

269
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:28,594
Bastards!

270
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:30,528
Bastards.!

271
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:37,966
This world is full of uncivilized people.

272
00:19:38,074 --> 00:19:39,701
Don't pay them any attention.

273
00:19:40,676 --> 00:19:42,871
Again? From the top?

274
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:52,546
So, the doctor has to
check for food poisoning.

275
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:55,088
Good.

276
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:57,716
Do you mind - l have to
send him a stool sample?

277
00:19:58,828 --> 00:19:59,658
Fuck off.

278
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:03,963
Patient name?

279
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:05,124
Nitin Berry.

280
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:11,205
Mr. Bhatia...

281
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:28,847
Okay, l'll talk to you later.

282
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:13,299
Sir...

283
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:15,165
this is shit.

284
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:19,166
Thank you .

285
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,578
Sisterfucker.

286
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:47,627
New car?

287
00:21:47,737 --> 00:21:48,431
Yes.

288
00:21:48,537 --> 00:21:51,506
Very nice! Beauty, great colour.

289
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:52,596
Thank you , Mr. Jain.

290
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:57,009
Mr. Tashi, l just wanted to remind you
that the rent is due next week.

291
00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:58,205
l know, Mr. Jain.

292
00:21:58,314 --> 00:21:59,440
Good. Good. Very good.

293
00:21:59,548 --> 00:22:01,106
lt is just that it was
late last month -

294
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,119
- and the month before
that also, that's why.

295
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:11,317
You said you 'll speak to
Mr. Maharaj about the dancing.

296
00:22:11,427 --> 00:22:13,088
Every night bharatnatyam
on our heads.

297
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:14,355
Kathak.

298
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:15,555
See, l spoke to him -

299
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:18,295
- and he said that he will try
and take his class early.

300
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:19,663
That was last week.

301
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:20,633
Really?

302
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:32,479
Hi.

303
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:33,513
What's wrong with you ?

304
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,376
Bastard, l'm dying.

305
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:37,580
Okay. And you ?

306
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:39,654
Meeting Ritu for a movie.

307
00:22:39,755 --> 00:22:41,347
''Return of Disco Fighter''

308
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:43,717
Where are my pants?

309
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,860
Okay, just hang on a second -
something l want to talk to you about.

310
00:22:46,962 --> 00:22:47,724
Two things.

311
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,525
l don't know about that Ritu .

312
00:22:49,632 --> 00:22:51,361
That girl, she doesn't
give me a good feeling.

313
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:52,791
Yeah, she's my girlfriend -

314
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:54,460
- only supposed to
give me a good feeling.

315
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,197
You 're my witness.
l warned him.

316
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:58,205
Listen, rent's due next week.

317
00:22:58,674 --> 00:23:00,699
- l'd like to pay it on time this month.
- Sure.

318
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:02,607
Nitin?

319
00:23:02,712 --> 00:23:04,339
Yeah, l'm not paying rent anymore.

320
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:05,745
ldiot.

321
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:06,815
You 're moving out?

322
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:07,678
No.

323
00:23:08,584 --> 00:23:10,279
You 're not moving out and
you 're not going to pay rent.

324
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:11,879
How the fuck are you
going to manage that?

325
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:14,281
Check this out.

326
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:23,454
What the hell is this?

327
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:25,625
lt's a naked man lying
on top of a naked woman -

328
00:23:25,735 --> 00:23:26,861
- it's called fucking.

329
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:28,701
This is Manish, our landlord.

330
00:23:29,271 --> 00:23:30,932
Yeah, the fucking wife-cheater.

331
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,507
And that's Leena.

332
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:34,034
She's a whore.

333
00:23:34,143 --> 00:23:35,075
No.

334
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:37,111
l thought she was sucking his dick
because she's really outgoing -

335
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:38,180
- but a whore you say, my God.

336
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,872
Bastard, if l wasn't sick,
l'd fucking give you one.

337
00:23:40,316 --> 00:23:41,340
How'd you get these?

338
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,474
No, that's the wrong question.

339
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:44,780
The right question is,
are we going to pay rent anymore?

340
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:46,652
And the answer is?

341
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,815
No. No more rent.
No more fucking rent.

342
00:23:52,328 --> 00:23:53,454
What are you talking about?

343
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:55,587
l'm talking about a small
business transaction with our landlord.

344
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:58,223
He gives us some money and
these pictures don't get to his wife.

345
00:23:59,668 --> 00:24:00,692
You 're going to blackmail him?

346
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:03,394
lt's not blackmail.
lt's a sign, from God.

347
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:04,700
Oh, you 're going to blackmail him.

348
00:24:04,807 --> 00:24:06,934
We're living with a criminal.
lt's Nitin Sobhraj.

349
00:24:07,343 --> 00:24:09,834
l'm just the higher moral authority
in Manish's life -

350
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:11,708
You 're the higher moral authority
in his life?

351
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:13,714
Yes, yes, and l'm asking
him to mend his evil ways -

352
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:14,908
- l'm not a benevolent god.

353
00:24:15,284 --> 00:24:16,308
Don't tell me anymore, right -

354
00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:17,646
- because when the cops
come to get you ,

355
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:19,186
l don't want to be dragged in
as an accessory.

356
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:21,688
An accessory?
Listen to him using big words.

357
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,656
An earring is an accessory, you choot -

358
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:26,592
- listen l've been in this business
for two years, nobody gets -

359
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:28,663
l'm sorry, you 've been in this
business for two years?

360
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,200
Listen, l do all the work -

361
00:24:33,302 --> 00:24:35,600
- you fuckers get to save rent money.
Everybody wins.

362
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,280
And two?

363
00:24:50,753 --> 00:24:52,880
Two? l'm getting married.

364
00:24:52,988 --> 00:24:54,615
Yeah, we know that.

365
00:24:54,723 --> 00:24:56,588
No, getting married next month.

366
00:24:57,426 --> 00:24:59,155
Really, l thought this wasn't happening
till like next year.

367
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:02,426
Yeah, but then l thought, what difference?
Sooner the better.

368
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:04,795
Right up till the moment
they chop his head off,

369
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,925
the goat thinks he's going for a walk
in the park.

370
00:25:07,036 --> 00:25:09,402
Bastard, you 're just too negative.
l hate this attitude.

371
00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:11,530
Listen, this is great news.
Come here, give me a hug.

372
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,368
Great news!

373
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:13,873
Fucker, l was looking for these -

374
00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:16,638
- your ass is like a solar eclipse, man.

375
00:25:17,012 --> 00:25:20,812
Listen she's too hot, l was going to
marry her myself, but you can have her.

376
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:23,282
She's too sexy, you lucky bastard!

377
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:25,513
He's moving out.

378
00:25:26,622 --> 00:25:27,816
You 're moving out?

379
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:31,618
Then why the fuck were you
going on about the rent?

380
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,891
Tashi, you really should shave, baby.

381
00:26:18,841 --> 00:26:22,777
HeIIo? Menaka? Yes -

382
00:26:22,878 --> 00:26:24,675
Tashi? Tashi, get back in there!

383
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,678
l know where it is -

384
00:26:26,782 --> 00:26:27,874
Okay, should l bring Nitin?

385
00:26:28,384 --> 00:26:29,476
l can't believe you !

386
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:31,886
- Okay, bye.
- Oh, my God, this guy.

387
00:26:31,987 --> 00:26:33,750
Fucking buffoon.

388
00:26:35,557 --> 00:26:36,581
Baby, l've got to go

389
00:26:36,692 --> 00:26:38,717
Look, it's work, l swear
l'll make it up to you , okay?

390
00:26:38,827 --> 00:26:40,920
Just go, Tashi, just go.

391
00:26:49,104 --> 00:26:50,036
Thank you .

392
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:53,640
Do you see her, right behind me?
Don't look, don't look.

393
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:55,737
What about her?

394
00:26:55,844 --> 00:26:56,936
That's Kanika Tuli.

395
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:58,906
l heard she's a lesbo.

396
00:26:59,815 --> 00:27:02,113
Really? Where'd you hear that?

397
00:27:02,484 --> 00:27:03,644
Oh, you know, here and there.

398
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:08,012
Considering some of the men
l've been with, that doesn't sound half bad.

399
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:14,391
Oh, come on, don't tell me you 've never
thought about being with a woman.

400
00:27:14,997 --> 00:27:16,589
No! Never!

401
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:22,168
So, did you see Rajeev yet?
l think he's around.

402
00:27:22,838 --> 00:27:23,702
Nope.

403
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:28,473
Excuse me.

404
00:27:28,844 --> 00:27:29,606
Sure.

405
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:43,656
Do you see her? Don't look.

406
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:46,592
That's Menaka Vashisht.
She's a lesbo.

407
00:27:46,695 --> 00:27:47,491
Really?

408
00:27:48,697 --> 00:27:49,994
So, what's the story?

409
00:27:50,532 --> 00:27:51,624
Story?

410
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:53,998
Yeah, you know, you called me, gave me
the address, told me to come over -

411
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:57,129
Yeah, l know - l'm not that drunk. Yet.

412
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:00,633
l didn't say anything about a story,
l just gave you the address.

413
00:28:00,743 --> 00:28:02,370
So l came here for nothing?

414
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:05,106
No, to have a drink, have some fun.

415
00:28:05,214 --> 00:28:06,977
Tashi, stop working.

416
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,010
l was in the middle of something -

417
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:10,710
Couldn't have been that important.

418
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,779
What?

419
00:28:12,154 --> 00:28:13,587
Why'd you pick up the phone then?

420
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,024
l'm glad you 're having fun -

421
00:28:19,128 --> 00:28:21,187
- l'll talk to you tomorrow.
When you 're sober.

422
00:28:21,997 --> 00:28:23,055
Tash, come on.

423
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:24,564
Lover's spat?

424
00:28:25,534 --> 00:28:28,002
Rajeev, l'm not in the mood
for your bullshit, okay?

425
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,869
So why don't you just leave?

426
00:28:30,472 --> 00:28:31,769
Make me.

427
00:28:31,874 --> 00:28:33,603
Listen, man - l don't know you , okay?
Do you mind?

428
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:35,233
Yeah. l mind.

429
00:28:35,711 --> 00:28:36,609
What the fuck?

430
00:28:36,712 --> 00:28:37,644
What's your problem, man?

431
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:39,680
What did you just say?
What the fuck?

432
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:40,510
- Come on, say it again!
- Guys!

433
00:28:40,616 --> 00:28:41,583
Say it again, come on.

434
00:28:41,683 --> 00:28:44,015
Listen, man, l'm not
looking for trouble, alright?

435
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:46,787
No, bitch,
trouble's looking for you .

436
00:28:48,924 --> 00:28:50,949
- Should've kept your mouth shut!
- Leave me alone, you bastard!

437
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,119
- Now mind your fucking business!
- You bastard!

438
00:28:53,595 --> 00:28:55,290
- Come here, you , come here -
- You fucking bastard!

439
00:28:55,397 --> 00:28:56,523
You think you can
get away with this -

440
00:28:56,632 --> 00:28:58,190
- nobody messes with
Rajeev Khanna and gets -

441
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:07,108
Let's go - he has friends.

Fucker.!

443

- Are you all right?

444
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,927
Let me see that -

446
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:33,330

447
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,669

00:29:39,641 --> 00:29:40,630
lt's okay.

450
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,768
What do you mean, loosen up?

451
00:29:42,878 --> 00:29:43,867
No, l didn't mean it like that -

l am loose, okay?

453
00:29:45,981 --> 00:29:47,744
With friends, people who know me -

454
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,715
- people who don't feel the need to
drag me half-way across the city -

455
00:29:49,818 --> 00:29:51,786
- in the middle of the fucking night,
so l can loosen up.

456
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:54,689
Don't be an asshole.

00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,882

- Where should l drop you off?
- Just - wherever.

459
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:04,065
Fuck!

- But which one?
- Fuck it, let's go!

490
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:08,585
That's fine, that's fine.
Don't worry about it.

491
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,748
Okay, ma'am.

492
00:32:09,858 --> 00:32:12,019
- Bathroom? ls it done?
- Yes ma'am. Thank you , ma'am.

493
00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:13,025
Thank you .

494
00:32:13,962 --> 00:32:14,758
Thank you , sir.

495
00:32:25,974 --> 00:32:27,407
Fuck, my car.

496
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:29,173
My brand new car.

497
00:32:30,012 --> 00:32:31,172
Who's the asshole?

498
00:32:32,314 --> 00:32:33,872
My husband.

499
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:38,214
Ex-husband, as soon as
the divorce papers show up.

500
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,984
l can't believe he took a shot at me.
Where'd you find him?

501
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:47,386
Oh, you know. Arranged marriage.

502
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,829
Parents forced me.

503
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:51,763
Really?

504
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:55,496
No. He was my boyfriend in school -

505
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:57,871
- l actually ran away from
home to marry him.

506
00:32:57,973 --> 00:32:59,770
l fought with my parents.

507
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:01,307
You know how to pick them.

508
00:33:03,178 --> 00:33:04,736
Sitting here with you .

509
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:11,317
l'm going to get some coffee.

510
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,214
You want some?

511
00:33:13,322 --> 00:33:14,448
You can't just do that. That's not -

512
00:33:14,556 --> 00:33:15,716
Anyone who can afford to stay

513
00:33:15,824 --> 00:33:17,792
at this hotel,
can afford to buy us a cup of coffee -

514
00:33:17,893 --> 00:33:18,791
Cappuccino okay?

515
00:33:19,294 --> 00:33:20,454
What, you do this on a regular basis?

516
00:33:20,962 --> 00:33:24,022
No, just on days
l get shot at by my ex-husband -

517
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:26,862
- hi, l'm calling from room 509 -

518
00:33:26,968 --> 00:33:29,368
- can you please send up
two cappuccinos?

519
00:33:29,838 --> 00:33:31,897
Hold on.

520
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:33,999
Would you like something to eat?

521
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:40,272
No, just the coffees, thank you .

522
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:41,879
This is wrong.

523
00:33:42,451 --> 00:33:43,941
You need to fucking lighten up.

524
00:33:49,124 --> 00:33:50,148
Fuck it - let's go, come.

525
00:33:52,994 --> 00:33:54,825
Yes, baby!

526
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,421
Just a little harder!

527
00:33:59,234 --> 00:34:00,223
Excuse us!

528
00:34:00,335 --> 00:34:02,963
Oh my god! Yes, yes!

529
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:04,333
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.!

530
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:06,463
Yes, yes, yes!

531
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:08,199
Yes, yes, yes!

532
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,277
Like a horse!

533
00:34:09,845 --> 00:34:10,504

534
00:34:10,946 --> 00:34:12,140

00:34:19,988 --> 00:34:21,114
- come on.!

540
00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:31,088
l could've sworn that was our room.

541
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,134
Frank, l hope this isn't Alzheimer's.

542
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:36,527
Louise, the key worked!

543
00:34:36,938 --> 00:34:39,270
Mr. and Mrs. Eggen,
l have your coffee.

544
00:34:39,374 --> 00:34:40,500
We didn't order any coffee.

545
00:35:03,031 --> 00:35:04,328
Thanks for the lift.

546
00:35:06,435 --> 00:35:08,130
And l'd be happy to

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,532
You didn't shoot it.

549
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:14,407
'Night.

550
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:02,417
Did you put the buckets out?

551
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:06,152
Bastard, l'm dying.

552
00:36:28,483 --> 00:36:30,974
Man, did you drink all my juice?

553
00:36:35,457 --> 00:36:36,515
Yeah.

554
00:36:37,192 --> 00:36:39,217
There were like
3-4 cartons in there.

l know.

556
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,427
You don't even like orange juice.

557
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:46,430
Sometimes l do.

558
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:47,997
Man -

559
00:36:48,603 --> 00:36:50,298

560
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:52,134
Damn right you 'll buy me some more -

561
00:36:58,046 --> 00:37:01,174
Did you wash your ass
with my juice?

562
00:37:04,386 --> 00:37:06,149
Bastard, l told you
l'll buy you some more -

563
00:37:06,254 --> 00:37:08,313
- my fucking ass cheeks are
stuck together.

564
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:14,760
l can never drink orange juice again.

565
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:17,522
Yes, Mum -

566
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:19,930
- yes, how many times are you
going to tell me the same thing?

567
00:37:20,035 --> 00:37:21,366
Okay, Mum, and listen,

00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:24,097

my lehenga from the designer.

he will not be done on time.

570

00:37:33,448 --> 00:37:35,575
Hey, baby -

What?

574
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:38,246
What happened to you ?

575
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:41,553
Work.

576
00:37:41,656 --> 00:37:42,520
Work?

577
00:37:42,624 --> 00:37:45,149
Work? They don't pay you
enough to get killed.

578
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,762
My dad gives you a brand new car -

579
00:37:57,172 --> 00:37:58,696
- and this is what you do to it, Tashi?

580
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:05,674
You 're going to miss your flight.

581
00:38:22,797 --> 00:38:25,265
- This is it?
- Yes.

582
00:38:37,512 --> 00:38:38,376
Who is it?

583
00:38:41,082 --> 00:38:42,106
Sir, laundry.

584
00:38:43,351 --> 00:38:44,340
No, thanks.

585
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:50,417
Laundry?

lt's his birthday, we want to surprise him.

No, sir. l can't do that, sir.

608
00:39:50,418 --> 00:39:51,544
You have to deliver it?

609
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,252
Yes, sir.

610
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:55,822
For the reasons of quality?

611
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,315

Who is it?

615
00:40:12,707 --> 00:40:14,572
Room service. Sir, your lunch.

Sorry, but it's not my birthday.

619
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:36,488
What the fuck?

620

00:40:41,836 --> 00:40:43,269
Delivering your food, man.

623
00:40:43,671 --> 00:40:46,231
Unlike you , we make our deliveries.

624
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:50,470
What the fuck are you talking about?

625
00:40:50,912 --> 00:40:51,606
Bunty.

626
00:40:53,548 --> 00:40:54,776
Hey, easy!

627
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,575
This was a new shirt, man.

628
00:40:57,685 --> 00:41:00,449
- Even dry-cleaning won't get that out.
- Balls.

629
00:41:00,555 --> 00:41:03,251
Just got it from the tailor yesterday.

630
00:41:19,007 --> 00:41:20,531
Where is my package?

631
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:24,572
l sent it, like every time.

632
00:41:24,979 --> 00:41:26,776
But l didn't get it.

633
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:29,474
So, where is it?

634
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:30,573
l brought it in -

635
00:41:30,985 --> 00:41:33,476
- and gave it to the courier,
like every time!

636
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:40,258
There was this new girl.

637
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:44,489
New girl?

638
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,691
Yeah -

639
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,496
- my regular girl was sick, so -

640
00:41:48,603 --> 00:41:50,332
- she told me her friend
could help us -

641
00:41:51,472 --> 00:41:53,872
- could help us out, for free.

642
00:41:54,309 --> 00:41:55,298
Only this time.

643
00:41:57,412 --> 00:41:59,346
The new girl didn't know
what she was carrying.

644
00:41:59,814 --> 00:42:00,803
She didn't know!

645
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:02,707
Yeah -

646
00:42:02,817 --> 00:42:03,841
- l'm sure.

647
00:42:06,855 --> 00:42:08,516
Search the room.

648
00:42:16,631 --> 00:42:19,429
Sisterfuckers, what is this, a wedding?

649
00:42:23,504 --> 00:42:27,201
This is very nice, Arup.
Very nice.

650
00:42:27,675 --> 00:42:30,109
The client also liked it very much.

651
00:42:30,545 --> 00:42:34,003
Only thing, they felt that
the banana is smiling too much.

652
00:42:34,115 --> 00:42:36,640
Too happy.

653
00:42:36,751 --> 00:42:39,083
Why? He's about to get eaten -

654
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,785
- what could be wrong?

655
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,585

No one, Mum.

714
00:46:47,268 --> 00:46:48,200
Arup, you shouldn't be here.

715
00:46:48,302 --> 00:46:49,064
What's going on?

716
00:46:50,972 --> 00:46:51,904
Hey, guys -

00:47:08,856 --> 00:47:09,584
He doesn't know?

726
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:11,214
l was just about to tell him -

727
00:47:11,325 --> 00:47:13,156

A cartoonist?

Yeah, like Chacha Choudhry.

733
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,471
That's, that's funny.

734
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,139
Vivek, your tea is getting cold.

735
00:47:31,245 --> 00:47:32,439

Hey -

738
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:37,350
- old jungle saying -

739
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:39,919
- phantom fist is quicker than the eye.

740
00:47:40,354 --> 00:47:42,083
See you at the wedding.

741
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:50,296
When were you planning to tell me?

742
00:47:50,398 --> 00:47:51,524
Arup, it doesn't matter -

743
00:47:52,066 --> 00:47:53,397
- in a month, l'm moving to Canada.

744

Good luck with your cartooning.

747
00:48:12,286 --> 00:48:16,154
The bride and groom
may now exchange garlands.

748
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:19,854
Stop!

749
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:21,258
This marriage cannot happen!

750
00:48:35,076 --> 00:48:36,839
This girl has given me blowjob.

751
00:48:36,944 --> 00:48:37,603
Blowjob.

00:48:37,712 --> 00:48:38,371
Blowjob.

Blowjob.

754
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:46,946
And because l am 21 st century man,
l have given her oral pleasure also.

755
00:48:49,123 --> 00:48:51,284
Oh my God! Are you alright?

756
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,027
Shameless girl!

757
00:48:54,128 --> 00:48:56,221
You 've disgraced the family name!

758
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,456
Get out of my sight!

759
00:51:09,263 --> 00:51:10,355
You have two voice messages.

760
00:51:16,704 --> 00:51:18,763

00:51:42,696 --> 00:51:43,594
Good, good, good -

767
00:51:47,201 --> 00:51:48,600
- did you deliver it?

768
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:52,398
You know, actually, l didn't -
but l gave it to a friend to deliver -

769
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,167
- l had to do some shopping
before the flight.

770
00:51:56,343 --> 00:51:57,310
Are you crazy?

771
00:51:57,812 --> 00:52:00,610
After l told exactly what to do -

772
00:52:00,714 --> 00:52:02,147
- you think this is a joke?

773
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:03,614
You think this is a picnic -

774
00:52:03,717 --> 00:52:05,048
- that we are on a picnic?

775
00:52:05,152 --> 00:52:08,121
You are so fucking stupid!

776
00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:09,183
God.

777
00:52:09,723 --> 00:52:10,655
Hello?

778
00:52:14,528 --> 00:52:15,358
Well done.

779
00:52:24,505 --> 00:52:27,269
HeIIo, you 've reached SonIya.

780
00:52:27,374 --> 00:52:30,138
PIease Ieave me a message

781
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,444
Vladimir.

782
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:44,387
Hello, yes?

783
00:52:44,492 --> 00:52:45,686
Hello, Miss Soniya?

784
00:52:45,793 --> 00:52:46,817
Now who's this?

785
00:52:47,194 --> 00:52:49,628
Hi, Miss Soniya, this is Vladimir's supervisor -

786
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:51,721
- l'm calling to say sorry for his behaviour.

787
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:54,531
He's a very rude man, okay? Very rude -

788
00:52:54,635 --> 00:52:56,227
- l only did this as a favour to him, you know -

789
00:52:56,337 --> 00:52:57,531
- because he's a friend of a friend -

790
00:52:57,638 --> 00:52:59,629
- l helped him out, and look at this!

791
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,207
l mean -

792
00:53:01,308 --> 00:53:02,468
You 're right, you 're right -

793
00:53:03,143 --> 00:53:04,804
- l'll definitely take some action against him -

794
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:07,570
- some very strict action.

795
00:53:08,516 --> 00:53:11,644
By the way, where's that package
you had to deliver?

796
00:53:12,353 --> 00:53:14,548
Actually, l'm surprised it hasn't been delivered -

797
00:53:15,122 --> 00:53:17,647
- l gave it to a friend - he's usually
very good at these things.

798
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:21,890
Something must have happened,
you know - we all are busy people.

799
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:26,365
Why don't you give me his address,
l mean, l'll have it picked up -

800
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:27,399
Are you sure?

801
00:53:28,302 --> 00:53:29,234
No problem.

802
00:53:30,237 --> 00:53:31,636
Where should l write, on my hand?

803
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:33,366
Yeah, sorry?

804
00:53:35,276 --> 00:53:36,243
Yeah -

805
00:53:40,814 --> 00:53:41,803
What's his name?

806
00:53:48,656 --> 00:53:49,588
What the fuck?

807
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:57,690
Who's this?

808
00:53:58,599 --> 00:53:59,293
Tashi.

809
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:01,827
So you 're Tashi?

810
00:54:02,303 --> 00:54:03,429
Yeah, who the fuck are you ?

811
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:07,196
l ask the questions here -

812
00:54:07,308 --> 00:54:08,240
- you calm down.

813
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,070
So you 're not Tashi?

814
00:54:11,178 --> 00:54:13,237
No, sir. l told you -

815
00:54:13,614 --> 00:54:15,411
- may l get down now?

816
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:18,910
Where's my package?

817
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,314
Package?

818
00:54:40,474 --> 00:54:42,237
Enough, you fools.

819
00:54:46,547 --> 00:54:49,539
A girl called Soniya gave you a package.

820
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,447

989
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:54,427

990
01:07:58,071 --> 01:07:59,129
What are you doing?

991
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:00,536
l'm just, just checking.

992
01:08:01,141 --> 01:08:03,132
Saw this movie once, cash on top,

01:08:03,243 --> 01:08:05,302

997
01:08:10,383 --> 01:08:11,372
Staying right here.

998
01:08:12,185 --> 01:08:13,049
What?

999
01:08:13,153 --> 01:08:14,518
They'II, they'II fInd you , man -

Yeah, they'll find me, they'll beat me,

1001
01:08:18,091 --> 01:08:19,023
Bastard.

1002
01:08:21,494 --> 01:08:22,358
Give me the phone.

1003
01:08:32,105 --> 01:08:32,935

01:08:54,527 --> 01:08:55,289

1012
01:08:56,463 --> 01:08:58,294

Bannerjee.

1016
01:09:05,705 --> 01:09:06,364
Hack!

1017
01:09:06,473 --> 01:09:07,337
You fucking hack!

1018
01:09:08,374 --> 01:09:10,274
Blot on every Bong
art director in the business!

1019
01:09:10,376 --> 01:09:11,035
What?

1020
01:09:11,144 --> 01:09:11,940
l quit, l quit!

1021
01:09:12,045 --> 01:09:13,410
l quit, you talentless whore -

1022
01:09:14,481 --> 01:09:16,108
God - godamnIt, who Is thIs?

1023
01:09:16,216 --> 01:09:17,478
lt's Arup, you dumb fuck -

01:09:17,584 --> 01:09:18,380

1025
01:09:33,533 --> 01:09:34,192
Yeah?

1026
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,062
TashI.!

1027
01:09:36,269 --> 01:09:42,208
I want them back. In one hour.
Room 50 7, HoteI Raj PaIace.

1028
01:09:42,942 --> 01:09:46,434
Or I'II send her back by parceI post.

1029
01:09:49,282 --> 01:09:49,976
What?

1030
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:50,777
What?

1031
01:09:50,884 --> 01:09:51,543
Who is it?

1032
01:09:55,755 --> 01:09:56,483
They've got Soniya.

1033
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:57,957
They, who they?

1034
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:00,448
We have to take the diamonds back -

1035
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:03,251
- we have to return the money and
take the diamonds back.

1036
01:10:03,429 --> 01:10:04,157
What?

1037
01:10:04,264 --> 01:10:05,094
Take the money back?

1038
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:05,994
l just quit my job -

1039
01:10:07,267 --> 01:10:08,564
- no, you 're right,
we have to do the right -

1040
01:10:08,668 --> 01:10:12,195
l - they didn't recognize me,
l can always tell them it wasn't - crap!

1041
01:10:12,305 --> 01:10:13,636
But we take the diamonds back,
they kill us.

1042
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:14,729
Wasn't that the problem to begin with?

1043
01:10:14,841 --> 01:10:15,500
We don't have a choice.

1044
01:10:15,608 --> 01:10:16,472
We don't have a choice -

1045
01:10:16,576 --> 01:10:18,510
- what, we're just going to go back there
and get killed? That's the plan -

1046
01:10:18,611 --> 01:10:19,270
- to go back there and get -

1047
01:10:19,379 --> 01:10:20,437
Fuck, man, will you -

1048
01:10:20,547 --> 01:10:21,536
- shut the fuck up?

1049
01:10:31,558 --> 01:10:33,389
l hate your fucking girlfriend, man.

1050
01:10:40,733 --> 01:10:43,031
No problem.

1051
01:10:44,037 --> 01:10:46,062
Pay me back, take them.

1052
01:10:46,172 --> 01:10:48,106
They're yours, after all.

1053
01:10:49,976 --> 01:10:50,704
How much is this?

1054
01:10:51,377 --> 01:10:53,345
The 90 lakhs you gave us, all of it.

1055
01:10:54,013 --> 01:10:55,537
How many do you want to buy?

1056
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:57,742
All of them.

1057
01:11:00,053 --> 01:11:02,214
That'll be double then.

1058
01:11:03,656 --> 01:11:07,524
Look, the 90 lakhs you gave us,
l'm giving it all back.

1059
01:11:07,627 --> 01:11:09,288
Please, just return our diamonds.

1060
01:11:17,003 --> 01:11:23,806
The guys who sold me the diamonds
had no idea of their value.

1061
01:11:24,043 --> 01:11:26,409
But l did. That's why double.

1062
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,275
Look, l'm begging you -

1063
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:31,912
- it's a matter of life and death.

1064
01:11:32,018 --> 01:11:33,042
My frIend -

1065
01:11:33,519 --> 01:11:36,113
- l've heard these sob stories before.

1066
01:11:36,623 --> 01:11:39,751
l'm running a business, not a charity.

1067
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,655
Somebody will die, okay,
you understand?

1068
01:11:43,196 --> 01:11:44,993
We were here half-an-hour ago,
nothing has changed.

1069
01:11:45,098 --> 01:11:46,463
This is my final offer -

1070
01:11:47,467 --> 01:11:48,627
- double.

1071
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,293
Tashi, no, no!

1072
01:11:51,337 --> 01:11:54,067
Throw him out!

1073
01:11:55,174 --> 01:11:57,665
Throw the motherfucking bastard out!

1074
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:03,642
Where are we going?

1075
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:04,774
Times of lndia.

1076
01:12:05,718 --> 01:12:06,582
For what?

1077
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,378
l have a plan.

1078
01:12:08,488 --> 01:12:10,012
Drag me half-way across the city?

1079
01:12:10,123 --> 01:12:11,522
l only do that for people who know me -

1080
01:12:11,624 --> 01:12:14,286
- for friends, and in the middle
of the fucking day!

1081
01:12:15,395 --> 01:12:16,760
l have a deadline.

1082
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:18,160
Trust me -

1083
01:12:18,631 --> 01:12:19,461
- so do l.

1084
01:12:26,339 --> 01:12:27,636
This is the plan?

1085
01:12:31,577 --> 01:12:33,602
Find a parking spot,
sit tight till we show up -

1086
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,445
- simple as that.

1087
01:12:35,548 --> 01:12:36,708
Nothing to worry about -

1088
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:37,742
- watch it!

1089
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:38,509
Hey, aunty.!

1090
01:12:38,618 --> 01:12:39,676
Fuck off, you half-wit!

1091
01:12:40,186 --> 01:12:41,483
Can't see with this thing in my face!

1092
01:12:42,355 --> 01:12:43,720
Whatever you do,
keep your face covered.

1093
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:46,715
l'm assuming there's going to be
an explanation at some point?

1094
01:12:46,826 --> 01:12:48,657
Yes, of course, but later.

1095
01:12:49,195 --> 01:12:50,287
Did you get the money?

1096
01:12:50,396 --> 01:12:51,328
Yeah.

1097
01:12:51,431 --> 01:12:53,626
Why do we have to give it back?
The guy's an asshole.

1098
01:12:53,733 --> 01:12:54,563
This isn't a robbery -

1099
01:12:55,101 --> 01:12:56,693
- we're taking back what's ours,
returning what's his.

1100
01:12:56,803 --> 01:12:57,633
Ours?

1101
01:12:57,737 --> 01:12:58,726
Nothing is ours -

1102
01:12:58,838 --> 01:13:00,533
- we're just the dumb fucks
stuck in the middle!

1103
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,572
We should keep the fucking money -

1104
01:13:02,008 --> 01:13:02,667
Cow!

1105
01:13:10,183 --> 01:13:12,617
You drive, let me do the thinking.

1106
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:19,322
Stop here, stop here.

1107
01:13:19,425 --> 01:13:20,255
Why here?

1108
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:22,560
Because, I don't want to puII up
at the store In a brIght red car.

1109
01:13:29,635 --> 01:13:31,865
Okay, find a spot as close to the store
as you can, park there.

1110
01:13:32,438 --> 01:13:34,531
Man, l'm dying in this.
Do you know how hot this thing is?

1111
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,471
Yes, l'm wearing one.

1112
01:13:42,515 --> 01:13:44,642
Move, you fuck -
are you blind?

1113
01:13:51,891 --> 01:13:53,688
No, not this either.

1114
01:13:54,227 --> 01:13:56,252
Ma'am , how about thIs one?

1115
01:13:56,362 --> 01:13:58,057

1118
01:14:03,169 --> 01:14:05,865

1119
01:14:06,405 --> 01:14:07,235
Okay, ma'am.

Let's go, everything's crappy.

1123
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,774
Hold on, hold on!

1124
01:14:19,285 --> 01:14:20,853
What's the matter, ma'am?
You didn't like anything?

1125
01:14:20,853 --> 01:14:22,320
No, this is garbage.

1126
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:27,757
Why don't you step into my office?
l have something you 'll love.

Thank you .

1138
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:41,561
What range are you looking in?

1139
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,601
Price is no object.

1140
01:15:44,036 --> 01:15:47,699
Only a connoisseur
can appreciate true craftsmanship.

1141
01:16:06,726 --> 01:16:08,591
Here you go. Just for you .

1142
01:16:09,595 --> 01:16:13,656
You won't find such fine work
anywhere else, l guarantee it.

1143
01:16:13,766 --> 01:16:15,199
Does it come with anklets?

1144

Of course, let me show you .

1145

what's mine. Your money's outside.

1147
01:16:53,472 --> 01:16:54,530
You won't get away -

1148
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,073

Do you know how long
l've been in this business?

1250
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:41,959
What do you think -

1251
01:25:42,868 --> 01:25:47,305
- putting a gun to my head gives you
permission to fuck me in the ass?

1252
01:25:47,406 --> 01:25:48,065
Sisterfucker!

Stop, damn it -

1273

1277
01:30:41,166 --> 01:30:43,828

lt's in my father-in-law's name -

1279
01:30:46,304 --> 01:30:48,101
- he reported it stolen,
that should cover our asses.

1280
01:30:48,206 --> 01:30:49,104
He's not your father-in-law.

1281
01:30:49,875 --> 01:30:50,773
Yeah, yeah.

1282

He called it off?

So you don't mind if l ask
Soniya out to dinner, right?
